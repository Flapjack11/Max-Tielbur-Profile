My name is Maxwell Tielbur, and I am a Senior Marketing Major working towards a certificate in sales and digital marketing.

In my free time, I enjoy lifting weights and spending time with friends. I have achieved multiple certifications through Salesforce, Google, and Citi. I am looking for a job in the marketing field but I am open to any opportunities to grow my skills.

### Background

I was born in Illinois, United States, and I have been at NIU since 2022. I started my college career as a computer science student and decided to switch to marketing during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Before coming to NIU, I played Division 2 Ice Hockey with the Florida Southern Mocs where I played as a defenseman. I have continued my career in hockey through men's league. My favorite hockey team is the Pittsburgh Penguins!

When I am not working on my studies I often play games and compete with my friends to fuel my competitive edge. I am looking for opportunities that push my limits and challenges me to learn.
